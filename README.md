Thank you for purchasing my G2A Method . With this method , you will be
able to get anything from https ://www .g2a.com / completely for free . This
exploit works for any product available for sale on G2A, for example:

Giftcards - https://www.g2a.com/category/gift-cards-c6


Games - https://www.g2a.com/category/games-c189

How does it work?
It's simple . We will use a Tampermonkey script that changes the timezone
of our browser whenever we make a new order on G2A. As soon as we are
redirected to the payment page, our timezone will change, which will result
in our order being marked as "Expired " on G2A's payment processor -
Bitbay. 

However, the order will not be marked as expired on G2A's side . If
we pay for the products , the order will be successfully processed and
delivered by G2A, but the money will be instantly refunded to our wallet by
Bitbay.

Here is a summary of the process:

1. Install the Google Chrome extension Tampermonkey.
2. Install a script that changes your browser's timezone after making
an order on G2A.
3. Create a new order on G2A and pay for the products with Bitcoin.
4. Claim your products (the order will be successfully processed by G2
A).
5 . Wait a few minutes for a refund from Bitbay (Bitbay is a Bitcoin
payment processor for G2A. They will refund your money because
the order is marked as "Expired" on their side due to the timezonecon
flict).

Important: Please read this or it won't work.
Keep in mind that Bitbay will only refund your expired order if it is above 0.
005 BTC. Any lower amount is not prioritized by their refund system and will
require you to contact G2 A's support to get a refund .

****G2A TIMEZONE GLITCH UPDATED VERSION****
EXPLOIT CREATED BY z0diak@Nulled.to
Okay, let’s begin.

Here are the things you need:
- At least 0.005 BTC to pay for the order
- Google Chrome browser
- Tampermonkey extension
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

If the link is no longer working, simply google for Tampermonkey
and you will find it

- A Script that changes the Timezone. You can copy it from this link:
Important: If you get any errors while trying to make an order, check
the lastpage of this eBook for possible solutions.

Edit: I have received multiple questions asking if this script will work with
other payment methods . The answer is no. If you want to use this method,
you must use Bitcoin. It's not hard to buy crypto nowadays , so it shouldn 't
be a problem . Important note : Some products may have the Bitcoin option
disabled . In that case , you should try adding other items to your cart or
trying with lower prices of a single product but increased number of
products . Sometimes adding at least 2 products to your cart fixes this
problem, even if the option wasn’t available for just 1 product in the cart.

If you have everything ready - follow these steps:

Step 1. Add the Tampermonkey extension to your
browser.

Step 2. Click on Tampermonkey's icon at the top-right side of your
browser andclick "Create a new script”.
Important : If you can 't find the Tampermonkey icon , click here in your
Google Chrome browser and then pin the extension . When you do that,
the extension will be visible in the top-right corner of your browser.

Step 3. Remove any preset code so you have a clean page like the
screenshot below:

Step 4. Copy the script from this link:
Then paste it in the editor from step 3. It should look like the screenshot above.

Step 5. Go to “File” and click “Save”.

Step 6. Make sure that your script is enabled. It should look like the
screenshot below:

Step 7. Go to https://www.g2a.com/ and add some products to
your cart. For example, I will purchase a $500 Amazon gift card.
Accept the terms and conditions, insert your email address,
and click" Continue to payment".

Step 8. Now choose Bitcoin. Sometimes the "Bitcoin" option is not visible.
In that case, just click on "Show more methods" at the bottom of the list,
and youshould see this payment option as well. Then click "Continue".

Step 9. Now simply pay for the products by sending Bitcoins to
the address displayed in your order.
Once you pay for the order, just wait for 1 confirmation in the
blockchain. Assoon as your transaction gets 1 confirmation in the
blockchain (it shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes), you will receive
an email from G2A with yourpurchased products.
Now you will be redirected to the payment page with payment details (
address,amount and qr code) and if the script is working correctly, you
should see thisalert:

Step 10. Now click "Confirm payment" and you will see this
message:

It usually takes from 0 to 15 minutes to get your money refunded by
Bitbay. Isent the payment at 2:13 AM and was refunded 12 minutes
later (it onlydepends on how quickly your payment gets confirmed in
the blockchain).
And… this is what I received in my email:
Which is literally a free $500 gift card since my payment was
refunded, but the product was sent to my email anyway.
On the next page, you can find possible errors that may occur
while using this method but i have added a list of solutions
incase that happens to you.

Possible Errors:
If you can't see payment methods, or if you can't "Continue" to see the
Bitcoin address, amount, and you see the "Something went wrong"
message oranything similar, it means that either your IP/email/
session/browser fingerprinthas been banned. In that case, you
should first try:

1) Clearing your cookies and try again, if error persists, try:
2) Clearing cookies again and using a dierent email on
checkout thistime. If the error persists, try:
3) Changing your IP address (try using a VPN - I personally use
NordVPN) + take actions from Step 2 again.
4) If you still get this error, then change your IP again, use a
dierent email, but this time use an "Incognito mode" in
Chrome.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Go to chrome://extensions/ (paste this in the
address bar and press Enter)
2. Go to "Details" of the Tampermonkey
extension
3. Allow it to be used in "Incognito
mode"
4. Open "Incognito mode"
5. Repeat all the steps from the guide (including adding the
scriptagain). Also, remember that whenever you close the
incognito tab,the script will be removed and you will have to
add it again.
Another error:
If you can’t see Bitcoin payment option (but you can see every other
one), just clean your cookies, if it doesn’t work, clean your cookies,
change your IPaddress and use a dierent e-mail. It will help 100%.
